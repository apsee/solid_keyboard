I am creating this ortholinear keyboard for personal use and to have experience working with a PCB house outside of my profession.

I have tried to angle the keys at angles that correspond to how my wrists point when I am typing. The smaller footprint is for 
portability. I included a rotary encoder and OLED switch for future use.
